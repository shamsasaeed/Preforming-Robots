## Questions

## Observations and Reactions

In the first paragraph of page one, the reading covers on the idea that a robot is "capable of greater intelligence and of more dazzling performances than any specialized automation". I agree with this statement because I believe that robots bring a much desired and complex output, and with this, it could bring out successful machines and digital media displays. An automation has several limitations and too fixed that it cannot always bring out complex outputs. I think that the flexibility of a machine and the additions that could be added is very important, expecially when looking at how to make something special or unique. If I had the choice, I would choose to work with robots always because of the several options I could play around with, especially if I could go into the creative aspect of it.

In page four, I came across the idea that " "robot" which originally denotes "slave" through its association with the Czech word robota, meaning "compulsory labor". I was surprised at first because I did not know this before, but after giving it some thought I realized that this does make sense because we keep controlling the robot. They do not have freedom to do whatever they wanted, everything is coded, manipulated, or controlled. Even though sometimes random gets used, the random itself is also within a closed center of code. This made me questions this idea of the relationship between a robot and a human, is it good or bad? Later on the reading added a quote that "it's unfortunate that we've become slaves to these damned things [computers]" This quote made me shift my thoughts again, so are we slaves or the robots? Maybe we both are, but in different ways, both humans and robots are in complete freedom. If we look at it, humans put whatever they want into the robot: emotion, movement, sound, then the robot would express freely what the humans wants to say, or what message must be conveyed for the audience.
