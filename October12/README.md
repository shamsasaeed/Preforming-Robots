# Inspiration
The quote I was inspired by and have used in my performance was said by Alan Rickman "If you judge a character, you can't play it".

# Observatiions
While I was saying my line, I noticed that the robot's movement had an impact on me, it kind of scared me when I actually could see some emotions through a machine right in front of me.

# Challenges
It was very difficult for me to act in front of a robot. It didn't seem to me that this robot was real, I kept getting out of character in the beginning since I couldn't take my role seriously eevn though I respected the robot.

# Ideas
Eventhough I have chosen a quote that is short, it has a great impact and a greater meaning behind it. What I had in mind was that since the robot was dressed poorly, like a maid, I wanted to comfort the robot by telling it that it shouldn't be mad or sad because of the role that was chosen for it.
