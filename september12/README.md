# Paper Response : Chapter 5: Robots: Asleep, Awake, Alone, and in Love

## Questions

2. Does the quote ‘human-like appearance gives a robot a strong feeling of presence’ relate to the idea that robots are more noticed if they were just like a copy of a human?
3. How did the two Bjork Robots express human emotions, was it really that realistic or just a 'show'?
4. Who defines a performace and determines who could perform in a show? Why does that lead to judgement?
6. When does a robot know what type of emotion to show, whether is it in the facial expression or the body movement?
7. If some say that robots are 'stupid' then does that make the human stupid as well because they are the ones that created the robots and gave them the limitation to what they could or could not perform?

## Observations and Reactions

In the section "Robots In Love" we could see that the Bjork robots are used for entertainment purposes and not a functioning person to perform a certain task. This first made me controversal and confused on why robots performed instead of humans. But after giving it some thought, I actually thought is was kinda cool for them to get creative with this performance. I did not think of the Bjork robots as machines that took over on what humans do but I thought of them as a unique perspective on what could be defined as a 'performance'. This is because a performace is not necessarily only meant for humans, it should be something that gives entertainment but there isn't a specific list on who could perform, so getting creative with this show, it was pretty cool to see how they used these robots to express emotions.

In the section "Marie Velonaki's The Woman And the Snow Man" the chapter shifts to a show that illustrates the combination of an interactive screen and creation of robots called an actroid. It was facinating to me to read the behind the scenes of the show, and I was hooked on the details of this show. It was no surprise to me that these machines were costly, especially because of the precise adaptations that are taken care of in the process of building these machines. These adaptations could involve measurements, mistakes, trials which could take on several costs regarding the process of trying to make the robot to look more human. I think making a robot look more like a human makes a person feel curios and more engaged on what is displayed on the performance.

In the section "Fish -- Bird" the performace was shown on a blue and red wheelchair and it involved love letters. I liked how creative the idea was, I would have never thought of something like this from the story to the objects and to what was displayed as an interaction between the two 'disguised' wheelchairs. Even the little details like the love letters that were "sent in by members of the public and visitors to the galleries where the work was shown" was something that touched me because of the work and thought that was put into this. The presentation of the two creative robots being in different colors and performing a gesture, something that wheelchairs cannot normally do.

In the section "Hirata Oriza's Robot Theatre" the combination of a human actor and female actroid was a smart mix in my opinion. This is because the audience might not notice at first who is who and it would make the play much more intense and engaging. When I read that the ' robot shows empathy for the young woman’s condition and comforts her by reciting poetry' I immediately thought of how or in what way the robot showed that emotion. I also wondered if I would've believed the robot's empathy or if I would have just not feel any emotions because I would know that it is just a robot, with 'pretending' emotions.
