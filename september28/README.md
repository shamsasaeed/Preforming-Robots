# Paper Response : 
# Chapter 6: The 'Other Actor' and Mechanical Actors

## Questions
1. Why are humans still expecting a living human being in a live performance today?
2. Does it have to be all humans or all robots, or can it be in between?
3. How important is human emotion in theatre?
4. Will the strange feeling towards that the audience feel towards these machines go away in the future?

## Observations and Reactions

In the first parapgraph of chapter six, the readings covers the expectations of live theatre, mentioning that people expect a living human being to perform in a live theatre. This made me questions this idea of why is it still difficult for people to accept that robots could also perform, not just humans. We also see in a circus that animals perform, so why can't we humans accept the fact that robots could also perform. In both cases, the circus with animals and the robots in theatre, humans are behind these performances, behind the whole process. Another point the paragraph addresses is the importance of using human emotions for our viewing pleasure. I think that this is the case because it gives us something to relate to, something to connect to robot. With animals, humans feel a connection because they have been with animals for several years and they are actually alive. But I believe that humans will get used to robots in the future, it will just take time, and many robot based projects to make humans get used to the idea of them. A coping stage that the paragraoh mentions is that humans are experimenting with various forms of digital actors alongside human actors. This could show that a human is comfortable to be in a live theatre with a robot by her or his side which could then lead to the audience to accept them eventually over time.

In the section, 'mechanical actors' the reading describes the "cold mental form of a robot" to be the most alien looking theatrical player. This does make sense because what we were used to a theatre would be human actors, so plotting in something entirely different is a shock to many people, including myself. However, this does not mean that I do not accept these robots, it just means that I am new to this, so make me feel comfortable with this new machine. SInce these "nonhuman others" have been build to facinate and amuse us, why does it make some people uncomfortable, does the audience need to pass by the strange emotions before finally accepting these unique robots? Only time will tell. I do agree that "robots are the main players in theatretical human-machine interactions" because they are used for a purpose. The coding, the building, the performance, they hold great value and this causes the creators of these performances to focus on these machines and deliver their message.
