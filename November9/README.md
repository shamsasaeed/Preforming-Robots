# Paper Response : Towards a Dramaturgy of Robots and Object-Figures by Peter Eckersall

## Questions
1. How does the shift from the robotics and virtual figures to be 'increasingly visible in live performances, functioning more as actors than simply objects' make people feel about them?
2. Since both virtual figures and robots involve the use of technology, why does each bring very different feelings?
3. When looking at humans and object machines next to them on stage, does that make the audience compare how the two perform or is it because they are so different, they are seen as unique in their own way when performing?


## Observations and Reactions

I found it interesting when the reading talked about the difference between robotic machines and virtual projections of figures. When thinking about the two, I seem to think that I am more comfortable with the robotic machines becuase seeing something in front of me makes be feel like it is more real, even though it could be intimidating, I think that the virtual figures scare me more because I am not aware whether or not these figures will be the next reality and so it makes me uncertain of what I am seeing through a screen.

The GOSSIP project was very interesting to me, especially the meaning behind the performance, showing how 'ugly' gossip could be. I really like when virtual figures and robotic machines are used in plays to display a message for the audience because this doesn't just mean that the audience has to focus on the machines or virtual figures but they actually deeply focus on what these machines or figures are trying to say, what significant message will come up, and when it does it could be very pwoerful.
