## Inspiration
The quote I was inspired by and have used in my performance was said by Alan Rickman "If you judge a character, you can't play it". Eventhough I have chosen a quote that is short, it had a great impact and a greater meaning behind it. 

## Observatiions
While I was saying my line, I noticed that the robot's movement had an impact on me, it kind of scared me when I actually could see some emotions through a machine right in front of me.

## Challenges
It was very difficult for me to act in front of a robot. It didn't seem to me that this robot was real, I kept getting out of character in the beginning since I couldn't take my role seriously eevn though I respected the robot.

## Ideas
What I had in mind was that since the robot was dressed poorly, like a maid, I wanted to comfort the robot by telling it that it shouldn't be mad or sad because of the role that was chosen for it. The rorbot did not accept my comfort and quicked stormed away, aggressively

## Questions
1. Why did people choose robots to be dramatic, is there a reason for this? A motive perhaps?
2. Can the robot become a human? (page 280)
3. How could the physical form and performance of a robot can be an ingredient (metaphorically)

## Observations and Reactions 

After reading the text and the examples, a text that really stuck to me revolved around the idea of humanizing the robot versis machanizing the human. I believe that switching the roles could be dangerous, this is because when a human tries to micmic the robot and the robot tries to micic the human there would be a controversal emotions towards that which could potentially lead to confusion. Aren't humans supposed to show emotion? They're the ones who actually have it. Why do robots show emotions when we all know they cannot really feel it? This idea could be resented by many because people may not accept what is not natural in the real world, regardless if it was a performance or not.
